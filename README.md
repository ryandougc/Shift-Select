# Shift-Select
A jquery plugin that allows you to shift click multiple checkboxes in table rows to easily select many rows at once

After searching for a solution to do this, I got inspired while looking at a stackexcahnge post and decided to write my own plugin for this. 

This is the post that I was inspired by: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/659508/how-can-i-shift-select-multiple-checkboxes-like-gmail

Credit for the initial logic behind the shift clicking goes to user BC. on stack exchange.
